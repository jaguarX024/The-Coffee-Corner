# The Coffee Corner Website

Welcome to **The Coffee Corner** website! This is an interactive, front-end web project for a local coffee shop, designed to showcase the shop's offerings and provide a user-friendly experience for visitors.

## Overview

This website allows users to:
- Explore the coffee shop's story and contact information
- Learn about job opportunities (Baker and Barista)
- Interact with an online ordering interface to simulate placing orders

## Pages

- **Home**: Introduction to the shop, schedule, and contact info.  
- **About**: Learn more about the shop's history and mission.  
- **Barista & Baker**: Job application pages with detailed requirements and application forms.  
- **Order Online**: A dynamic menu where users can select items, customize orders, and add them to a simulated cart. This page uses JavaScript for interactivity.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS**: Used throughout the site for structure and styling (especially on Home, About, Barista, and Baker pages).
- **JavaScript**: Powers the interactive ordering experience on the Order Online page.

## Important Notes
